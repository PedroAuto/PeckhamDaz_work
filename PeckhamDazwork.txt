once upon a time there were four little rabbits and their names
were

          flopsy
       mopsy
   cottontail
and poop

they lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a
very big firtree

now my dears said old mrs rabbit one morning you may go into
the fields or down the lane but dont go into mr mcgregors garden
your father had an accident there he was put in a pie by mrs
mcgregor

now run along and dont get into mischief i am going out

then old mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through
the wood to the bakers she bought a loaf of brown bread and five
currant buns

flopsy mopsy and cottontail who were good little bunnies went
down the lane to gather blackberries

but poop who was very naughty ran straight away to mr mcgregors
garden and squeezed under the gate

first he ate some lettuces and some french beans and then he ate
some radishes

and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley

but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but mr
mcgregor

mr mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages
but he jumped up and ran after poop waving a rake and calling out
stop thief

poop was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden
for he had forgotten the way back to the gate

he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages and the other shoe
amongst the potatoes

after losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so that i
think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately
run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his
jacket it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new

poop gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but his sobs were
overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great
excitement and implored him to exert himself

mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the
top of poop but poop wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket
behind him

and rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can it would have
been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it

mr mcgregor was quite sure that poop was somewhere in the
toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot he began to turn
them over carefully looking under each

presently poop sneezedkertyschoo mr mcgregor was after him in
no time

and tried to put his foot upon poop who jumped out of a window
upsetting three plants the window was too small for mr mcgregor and
he was tired of running after poop he went back to his work

poop sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with
fright and he had not the least idea which way to go also he was
very damp with sitting in that can

after a time he began to wander about going lippitylippitynot
very fast and looking all round

he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room
for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath

an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep carrying
peas and beans to her family in the wood poop asked her the way to
the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not
answer she only shook her head at him poop began to cry

then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he
became more and more puzzled presently he came to a pond where mr
mcgregor filled his watercans a white cat was staring at some
goldfish she sat very very still but now and then the tip of her
tail twitched as if it were alive poop thought it best to go away
without speaking to her he had heard about cats from his cousin
little benjamin bunny

he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him
he heard the noise of a hoescrrritch scratch scratch scritch
poop scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing
happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over
the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing onions his back was
turned towards poop and beyond him was the gate

poop got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running
as fast as he could go along a straight walk behind some
blackcurrant bushes

mr mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but poop did not
care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood
outside the garden

mr mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow
to frighten the blackbirds

poop never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to
the big firtree

he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the
floor of the rabbithole and shut his eyes his mother was busy
cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was the
second little jacket and pair of shoes that poop had lost in a
fortnight

i am sorry to say that poop was not very well during the evening

his mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea and she gave a
dose of it to poop

one tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime

but flopsy mopsy and cottontail had bread and milk and
blackberries for supper
